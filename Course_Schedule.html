            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Applied Single Cell Bioinformatics! We are really excited to have you and hope that together we can learn a lot!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="course-overview">
            <h2>Course Overview</h2>
            <p>This course is structured in two parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first part introduces various single-cell technologies and analyses, mainly focusing on scRNA-seq. The techniques and tools introduced are broadly applicable to other single-cell data.</li>
                <li>The second part involves group-based projects where you will work on real single-cell data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The course follows a “flipped classroom” approach, where you prepare by reading materials and watching lectures, ensuring more time for hands-on computational exercises during in-class sessions.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="expectations">
            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p>We expect you to prepare from home using the provided materials. These materials will not be covered during the in-person exercises. It's essential to complete the preparations to fully benefit from the exercises and understand the topics.</p>
            <p>This design allows for flexible learning and maximizes interaction with teachers and TAs, fostering a more efficient learning environment.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="examination">
            <h2>Examination</h2>
            <p>The examination consists of three parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Individual multiple-choice quiz in week 2</li>
                <li>Group project with a final hand-in</li>
                <li>Oral group presentation of the project</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The final grade is based on the overall performance in these three components.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="programming-environment">
            <h2>Programming Environment</h2>
            <p>Throughout the course, we will use R for data analysis, organization, and visualization. We expect you to be familiar with R and the basic tasks required, such as merging datasets, performing group operations, and using ggplot2 for visualization.</p>
            <p>An RStudio server with pre-installed packages and data will be used for all exercises. You will need to log in using your DTU credentials.</p>
            <p>Seurat will serve as the primary tool for single-cell analysis, supplemented with other R packages when needed.</p>
            <p>This is an applied course, focusing on post-quantification analysis of single-cell data.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- New "Prerequisites" section -->
        <section class="prerequisites">
            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <p>For the entire course we will use R to organize, analyze, and visualize data. This also means we REQUIRE that you are already comfortable with programming in R. You do not have time to learn that during this course! If you do not know how to solve basic data manipulation tasks in R (examples listed below), please contact the teacher.</p>
            <h3>Examples of data analysis you need to know how to do in R prior to course start (without looking it up online):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Merge two datasets based on a shared identifier</li>
                <li>Perform per-group operations based on a grouping column</li>
                <li>Perform per-row or per-column operations without using loops</li>
                <li>Use ggplot2 to visualize data, e.g., a scatterplot where points are colored by category</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are not comfortable with this, you will need to learn fast! There are hundreds of good sources for learning R, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>R for Data Science</i></li>
                <li><i>Modern Statistics for Modern Biology</i></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses">DataCamp Courses</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r">Codecademy R Course</a></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="environment-details">
            <h2>Environment</h2>
            <p>We will use an RStudio server which already has all R packages and exercise data installed.</p>
            <p>Log in with your DTU credentials, and you will need to authenticate twice—once for DTU login and once for the RStudio server. Please ensure your credentials are updated with multi-factor authentication before the course begins.</p>
            <p>We suggest bookmarking the RStudio server page as you will be using it frequently throughout the course.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="programs-used">
            <h2>Programs</h2>
            <p>We will use the Seurat package as the backbone for our single-cell analysis and supplement with additional R packages when needed or where Seurat's functionality is lacking.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="course-focus">
            <h2>Starting Point</h2>
            <p>This course begins after the data has already been quantified. We chose to focus on more applied and advanced analysis methods rather than the quantification process, which is computationally heavy and straightforward. Our focus is on post-quantification analysis of single-cell data.</p>
